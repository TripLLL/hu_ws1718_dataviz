University course on data visualization by Fabian Gülzau (ghithub:[FabianFox](https://github.com/FabianFox)) at Institute of Social Sciences Winter Term 17/18. 

The course had three main goals [description from course website]:
- Students should get an introduction to the statistical programming language R. Due to time limitations and the broadness of topics associated with R this won't be possible in an extensive manner. However, after the course students should be able to explore R further and conduct analysis on their own.
- Students will learn to manipulate data in R. More importantly, they will learn how to create functional and beautiful figures using R. Here, we will use many hands-on examples.
- Students will be introduced to the field of data visualization.

The content of this repository contain scripts and slides from Fabian Gülzau, as well as my own notes and exercises.
